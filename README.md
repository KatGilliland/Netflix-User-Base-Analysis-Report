# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal of this project was to analyze Netflix’s user demographics and usage patterns, with a focus on key metrics such as Lifetime Value (LTV). By exploring factors such as age, country, device preferences, and subscription types, my aim for this analysis was to provide Netflix with actionable insights to help enhance their business strategy.

# ABOUT THE DATA SET
The data being analyzed includes the following attributes for Netflix users:

User ID (A unique identifier for eahh Netflix user), Subscription Type (The type of Netflix subscription the user has such as basic, standard, or premium), Monthly Revenue (The revenue generated from the user's subscription on a monthly basis), Join Date (The date when the user joined Netflix), Last Payment Date (The most recent payment date for the user's subscription), Country (User location), Age (User age), Gender (User gender), Device (Type of device the user typically uses to access Netflix such as a smartphone, tablet, smart tv, or laptop), Plan Duration (the duration of the current subscription plan).
Country: The country where the user is located.

This data was used to better understand Netflix's user demographic and usage patterns, calculate Lifetime Value (LTV), and analyze key factors such as country, age, and device preferences. 

# TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
This project was completed using Jupyter Notebook and Python. In Python, I used the following libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly express, math. Pandas allowed me to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data, seaborn allowed for statistical data visualization, matplotlib allowed for static plots and visualization, plotly express allowed me the ability to create interactive plots, and math allowed me the ability to perform mathematical operations, such as the ability to round. 

# NEXT STEPS/RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of this analysis, I would recommend that Netflix employ targeted marketing campaigns to promote premium content and increase engagement in countries with a higher lifetime value (LTV), such as the United States and Spain. Additionally, it is important to note that France shows a notably higher average LTV, making it an especially strategic market for customer acquisition efforts. With access to marketing data, further analysis could be conducted to breakdown and evaluate the costs of customer acquisition by factors such as region, ensuring resources are effectively allocated where returns are highest.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to acknowledge that this project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial "Data Analytics Portfolio Project - Netflix customer base (Python)" by Karina Data Scientist (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdQpSxEbi8s). The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle, a platform that provides free and publicly available datasets.
